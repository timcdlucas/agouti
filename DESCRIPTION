Description: Disaggregation regression, or learning from aggregate outputs, has 
    developed piecemeal with different researchers focussing on 
	different aspects, such as spatial models. This package attempts to create 
	a widely applicable base giving classes and simple models that
	adequately capture the broad differences (mostly in terms of data 
	structure, and link functions) while leaving the specific models for add
	on packages.
