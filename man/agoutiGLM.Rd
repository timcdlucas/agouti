\title{Fit an aggregated output GLM}
\usage{
agoutiGLM(
  formula,
  data,
  ID,
  inner_link = "identity",
  outer_link = "identity",
  family = stats::gaussian(),
  weights,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula for the y and x variables.}

\item{data}{A data frame suitable for aggregate outputs models.}

\item{ID}{The column to use as the group ID column. Unquoted value.}

\item{inner_link}{A character defining the inner link function.}

\item{outer_link}{A character defining the outer link function.}

\item{family}{The error distribution defined with a family object or character.}

\item{weights}{Which column to use as within group weights such as
population or time.}

\item{...}{Further parameters. Currently unused.}
}
\description{
This function has flexibility for link functions both inside and outside the
aggregation step as well as a variety of error models. The models are fitted
with maximum likelihood and confidence intervals are given using the normal
approximation to the likelihood surface.
